  <string name="presetTitle1">Pure Writer - Connecting the past and future with words</string>
  <string name="presetContent1">Pure Writer is a fast and comfortable text editing app that prevents you from losing your works. While scrolling the comments and reviews of Pure Writer in Google Play, you might find some high praises for this app like "There\'s no app better than this", "The most satisfying app", "Love this app so much", "Love at first sight for this app"‚Ä¶ As the only developer for Pure Writer, the comments were especially gratifying for me. \nIn June 2017, after I went through countless uncomfortable, poorly done text editing products and lost my precious text files, I am determined to develop my own text editing app that allows its users to write anytime anywhere in a feature-filled and comfortable environment, knowing that their words will never disappear. This app, as I decided, will be developed with a writer\'s perspective. \nBefore all this, I was working part-time on a rich text editing software. Although we poured our hearts over it, the software did not turn out the way we wanted it to be. Despite that, I successfully developed some unique features that is more than enough for Pure Writer. \nAnd so Pure Writer is born. From the very beginning, Pure Writer took care of perfecting each line and character spacing on Android. This is the special feature that no other text editing android apps has achieved besides Microsoft Word. And yet the package size of Microsoft Word is more than ten times larger than Pure Writer\'s.\nNot only that, Pure Writer also provides special features like "launch text editor on app start" and especially "History records". As a writer myself, I understand the utmost importance of having a history record ‚Äî it allows you to focus on your writing while giving you a peace of mind that you will never, ever lose what you are writing. Even if your phone shuts down suddenly without any notice, Pure Writer can still save your content automatically. This way, all users are able to start and stop writing whenever they wish in a comfortable text editor with confidence. \nIn addition to that, Pure Writer supports "Input Shortcuts" and "Formatting tools", input shortcuts allows users to set their own custom words into the shortcut bar, so that they can reuse it over and over again with ease; formatting tools help users to quickly format their text for example auto spacing and arranging. \nNot only these features, a lot of effort was put into perfecting the tiniest detail in Pure Writer. While using Pure Writer, you are able to hide the soft keyboard by simply swiping the screen, get the cursor to be exactly where you want it to be and also keep the article still while you hide the soft keyboard‚Ä¶ If you were to compare Pure Writer to the other text editing apps, you will find that Pure Writer has perfectly taken care of all the small details that eventually contribute to a perfect writing environment.\nPure Writer has the editing tools you need for example: auto indentation, export article as various files including images, floating word count, canceling, Markdown, custom background themes, night mode, biometric encryption, text auto complete, sharing and much more. Despite all the features and details, Pure Writer still kept its minimalistic style and follows the Material Design guidelines. I also made a "Time Machine" for users to make small notes and keep them. The name "Time Machine" is taken from the comic, with the meaning of "Connecting the Past and Future with words". \nUntil today, Pure Writer\'s code base has received over one thousand commits and millions of lines changes. Although Pure Writer consumes almost all of my free time, it is always a relief that more and more users are giving me positive feedback. I actively connect with Pure Writer\'s users, collecting feedback and perfecting the app. I\'ve never felt happier at the thought of making something long term that helps other people. \nFinally, thank you to all my friends who helped me throughout this journey. Without you, this app would never be where it is today. With this post, I introduce you to the original ideas of Pure Writer and all of its special features, and hopefully more people would get to know it better. Let\'s hope that we are able to leave wonderful memories behind in the limited time we have. Let our Words take us back in time, and bring us to imagine the future.</string>
  <string name="presetTitle2">Pure Writer - Protective Mechanism</string>
  <string name="presetContent2">The current protective mechanism that Pure Writer has is: \n1. The article will be saved once the content is changed. If that fails, Pure Writer will notify the user immediately. \n2. Pure Writer will check if your content is saved in the database every two seconds. If it fails, Pure Writer will notify the user immediately. \n3. If it fails to autosave, then the users will not be able to exit the app completely. Pressing the exit button at this time is the same as pressing the Home button without completely stopping the app. This will allow some time for the user to manually save their content. \n4. Every time the app is running in the background or exited, it will automatically backup the whole database if any content is edited. The backup file can be accessed anytime. The backup will be save along with the previous version of the backup to allow users to revert the backup.\n5. The History record, undo and redo feature is provided to every article  \n6. Has a Trash folder to prevent accidental deletion of articles.\n7. Cloud backups: if Pure Writer is integrated with WebDAV, then it will automatically backup all the database content including the articles to the cloud.</string>
  <string name="presetTitle3">Pure Writer Pro</string>
  <string name="presetContent3">If you enjoyed using Pure Writer and wish to have it actively developed, would you mind contributing a few bucks to encourage the developer?\nYour support can encourage independent developers like me to make more useful apps. \nTo contribute, you can press the "Unlock Pro" button in the top right corner of the Settings page. As a token of appreciation, you will be able to get Pro features like "Save as‚Ä¶" and "Custom background/Papers". \nPure Writer will also improve as a result of your support. Thanks in advance! If you have any questions or feedback, please do not hesitate to email me at drakeet@drakeet.com</string>
  <string name="presetTitle4">Pure Writer - Privacy Policy</string>
  <string name="presetContent4">Pure Writer takes its users\' privacy very seriously, it will never collect any of your private information. \nAlso, it will not read or modify any content on your clipboard without first notifying you.\nThe storage permission that Pure Writer asked for is solely used for auto backup and save your files. Other than that, it will not read or modify any of your files in the storage without first notifying you.\nPure Writer supports cloud backup, which uses HTTPS encryption to transfer your database backups to your WebDAV cloud storage.

In addition, as the author of Pure Writer, I prefer the original Pure Writer design, which is more eye-catching and focused on text content, so this design feature is actually developed in response to the strong demands of a small number of users. It requires a lot of extra development costs, and it is not easy to provide, and since there will be two Pure Writer design now, the work of developers may multiply.\n\nBecause of this, Pure Writer will recommend you to pay for it, but you can still have a lot of time to experience and make a final payment decision. Please try to support it. If the statistics show that the proportion of users who are willing to pay is small, the developer may cancel or stop maintaining the Material Design 2. Once you click the OK, you will be deemed to agree to this content by default.\n\nThank you all! I will do my best to provide a better and better Pure Writer, please enjoy!</string>
